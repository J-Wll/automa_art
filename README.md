Generative interactive 'art' spiraly website. Adapted from an old project I first started years ago when I was new to programming, so, the code is a mess. 
Can change settings such as Randomization factor, Runtime, Opacity, Triangle Height, Moving offset and colours. Also has a responsive UI. (The canvas only scales at the end of each generation)
