                            <p>Stage one of developement was brainstorming ideas, creating a rough plan and placing it in the sturcture on trello, then I created a rough version of the layout using a website called draw.io. </p>
                            <p>Stage two involved learning the languages needed and then creating the basic html and css structure while trying to understand and create the javascript outside of course hours.</p>
                            <p>Stage 3 was putting it all together and fixing all my mistakes.</p>

                    <hr><p>Hi and welcome to my website, this website was created by me, Joe Westwell. I'm aspiring to be a software developer and i'm currently attending my first coding bootcamp with Code Nation; on this bootcamp I have learnt the basics of python, html and css. I also learnt a little bit of javascript on my own time to make this website a little more unique. <br><br> This website was developed for my final project on the Code Nation develop course, I had a hard time thinking of an idea I liked for a static website so I commited to learning some basic javascript to create interesting visual generating code.<br><br> </p>
                    <p>Some of the websites that inspired and helped me are:</p>
